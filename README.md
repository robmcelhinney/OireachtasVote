# OireachtasVote | View voting percentages of TDs in the current Dáil Éireann

Viewable at [https://robmcelhinney.github.io/OireachtasVote/](
https://robmcelhinney.github.io/OireachtasVote/)

Attempted to make this website so that it could solely be hosted by Github, 
no need to use external database or any server side code, a static webpage only.

## Install

    $ git clone git@github.com:robmcelhinney/OireachtasVote.git
    $ cd OireachtasVote
    $ npm install

## Start & watch

    $ npm start

## Simple build for production

    $ npm run build

## Future plans
Find a way to detect Ceann-comhairle and remove member from the list.

## Any ideas?
Let me know.
